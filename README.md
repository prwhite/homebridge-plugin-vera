# homebridge-plugin-vera

This will be primarily based off of the excellent @tonesto7 homebridge-smartthings-v2.

This is a _work-in-progress_. The motivation, in part, regards education regarding modern Javascript programming constructs such as classes, promises, arrow functions. The other part of motivation regards my ownership of two Veralite controllers, and the current lack of Vera support for HomeKit.

## Goals

- Improve my modern Javascripts skills.
- Understand the Vera API
- Allow reasonably complete control of Veralite via the Apple Home app.
